Description:
==============

This is a test set of calculations for Gold surface 111 and He on top of. We need to see if we can get all values from .wfn 
and KS-MAT as we did before. First real system. 


Files:

1. ** .dat :** Results obtained with the python codes stored in *source*.

2. ** .wfn :** Binary file where the wfn coefficients and eigenvalues are stored from a CP2K calculation.

3. ** .Log :** Printed eigenvalues/KS matrix from a CP2K calculation. 

4. ** output.out :** Output from a CP2K calculation.
